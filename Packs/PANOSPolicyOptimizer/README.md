The Policy Optimizer integration in this content pack provides you with a simple way to gain visibility into, control usage of, and safely enable applications in Security policy rules. 


## What does this pack do?
- Identifies port-based rules so you can convert them to application-based rules that allow traffic or adds applications to existing rules without compromising application availability. 
- Identifies rules configured with unused applications. 
- Helps you to analyze rule characteristics and prioritize which rules to migrate or clean up first.

As part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box Policy Optimizer incident views, a full layout and automation scripts. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.

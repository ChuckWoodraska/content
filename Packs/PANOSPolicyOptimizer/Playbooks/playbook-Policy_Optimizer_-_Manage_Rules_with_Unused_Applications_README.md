If you have application-based Security policy rules that allow a large number of applications, you can remove unused applications (applications never seen on the rules) from those rules to tighten them so that they only allow applications actually seen in the ruleâ€™s traffic. Identifying and removing unused applications from Security policy rules is a best practice that strengthens your security posture by reducing the attack surface.
